# Codebase Design

**This is a reference, not a process.** It fixes the words for designing code. It has no loop to
run, no artifact to produce, and no checkpoint to stop at — so *you* must not invent one.

**Stopping rule (mandatory):** When this skill is invoked, answer the vocabulary or design question
that was asked, then **stop**. Do not read files, survey a codebase, or propose refactors off the
back of this skill alone. If the task is "redesign X" or "find deepening opportunities", that is a
*job* — run it under a driver skill (`tech-review`, `grooming-architect`, `planning`, `grilling`),
using this skill only for the vocabulary and principles. The reference explains the words; the
driver decides the work.

Design **deep modules**: a lot of behaviour behind a small interface, placed at a clean seam,
testable through that interface. The aim is leverage for callers, locality for maintainers, and
testability for everyone.

## Glossary

Use these terms exactly: don't substitute "component", "service", "API", or "boundary". Consistent
language is the whole point.

**Module**: anything with an interface and an implementation. Deliberately scale-agnostic: a
function, class, package, or tier-spanning slice. _Avoid_: unit, component, service.

**Interface**: everything a caller must know to use the module correctly: the type signature, but
also invariants, ordering constraints, error modes, required configuration, and performance
characteristics. _Avoid_: API, signature (too narrow — they refer only to the type-level surface).

**Implementation**: what's inside a module, its body of code. Distinct from **Adapter**: a thing can
be a small adapter with a large implementation (a Postgres repo) or a large adapter with a small
implementation (an in-memory fake). Reach for "adapter" when the seam is the topic;
"implementation" otherwise.

**Depth**: leverage at the interface. The amount of behaviour a caller (or test) can exercise per
unit of interface they have to learn. A module is **deep** when a large amount of behaviour sits
behind a small interface, **shallow** when the interface is nearly as complex as the implementation.

**Seam** _(Michael Feathers)_: a place where you can alter behaviour without editing in that place;
the *location* at which a module's interface lives. Where to put the seam is its own design
decision, distinct from what goes behind it. _Avoid_: boundary (overloaded with DDD's bounded
context).

**Adapter**: a concrete thing that satisfies an interface at a seam. Describes *role* (what slot it
fills), not substance (what's inside).

**Leverage**: what callers get from depth. More capability per unit of interface they learn. One
implementation pays back across N call sites and M tests.

**Locality**: what maintainers get from depth. Change, bugs, knowledge, and verification concentrate
in one place rather than spreading across callers. Fix once, fixed everywhere.

## Deep vs shallow

**Deep module** = small interface + lots of implementation:

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Small Interface   │  ← Few methods, simple params
├─────────────────────┤
│                     │
│  Deep Implementation│  ← Complex logic hidden
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Shallow module** = large interface + little implementation (avoid):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│       Large Interface           │  ← Many methods, complex params
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  Thin Implementation            │  ← Just passes through
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

When designing an interface, ask:

- Can I reduce the number of methods?
- Can I simplify the parameters?
- Can I hide more complexity inside?

## Principles

- **Depth is a property of the interface, not the implementation.** A deep module can be internally
  composed of small, mockable, swappable parts; they just aren't part of the interface. A module can
  have **internal seams** (private to its implementation, used by its own tests) as well as the
  **external seam** at its interface.
- **The deletion test.** Imagine deleting the module. If complexity vanishes, it was a pass-through.
  If complexity reappears across N callers, it was earning its keep.
- **The interface is the test surface.** Callers and tests cross the same seam. If you want to test
  *past* the interface, the module is probably the wrong shape.
- **One adapter means a hypothetical seam. Two adapters means a real one.** Don't introduce a seam
  unless something actually varies across it.

## Designing for testability

Good interfaces make testing natural:

1. **Accept dependencies, don't create them.**

   ```typescript
   // Testable
   function processOrder(order, paymentGateway) {}

   // Hard to test
   function processOrder(order) {
     const gateway = new StripeGateway();
   }
   ```

2. **Return results, don't produce side effects.**

   ```typescript
   // Testable
   function calculateDiscount(cart): Discount {}

   // Hard to test
   function applyDiscount(cart): void {
     cart.total -= discount;
   }
   ```

3. **Small surface area.** Fewer methods = fewer tests needed. Fewer params = simpler test setup.

## Relationships

- A **Module** has exactly one **Interface** (the surface it presents to callers and tests).
- **Depth** is a property of a **Module**, measured against its **Interface**.
- A **Seam** is where a **Module**'s **Interface** lives.
- An **Adapter** sits at a **Seam** and satisfies the **Interface**.
- **Depth** produces **Leverage** for callers and **Locality** for maintainers.

## Rejected framings

- **Depth as ratio of implementation-lines to interface-lines** (Ousterhout): rewards padding the
  implementation. We use depth-as-leverage instead.
- **"Interface" as the TypeScript `interface` keyword or a class's public methods**: too narrow —
  interface here includes every fact a caller must know.
- **"Boundary"**: overloaded with DDD's bounded context. Say **seam** or **interface**.

## Using this skill with our other skills

This is the vocabulary layer *underneath* the engineering skills — the dictionary, not the driver.
Reach for it from:

| Driver | How it uses this vocabulary |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| `tech-review` | Name the module shape in the critique; judge an extraction with the deletion test. |
| `grooming-architect` | Describe the target interface and the guardrails in a ticket's language. |
| `impact-analysis` | Talk about the *seam* and its adapters, not "the API". |
| `planning` | State the interface (invariants, ordering, error modes) before listing steps. |
| `grilling` / `grill-with-docs` | Settle what "module", "interface", and "seam" mean during design. |
| `test-driven-development` | The interface is the test surface; test through it, not past it. |

Pairs with `domain-modeling`: that skill fixes the words for the *problem domain*, this one fixes
the words for the *code's shape*. A design session usually wants both.

## Going deeper

- **Deepening a cluster given its dependencies** — see [DEEPENING.md](DEEPENING.md): dependency
  categories, seam discipline, and replace-don't-layer testing.
- **Exploring alternative interfaces** — see [DESIGN-IT-TWICE.md](DESIGN-IT-TWICE.md): design the
  interface several radically different ways, then compare on depth, locality, and seam placement.
